# SigExec Demo Placeholders

This folder is intentionally minimal and only present to satisfy GitHub Pages' build requirements in CI.

The full demo site can be generated by running locally:

```bash
pip install staticdash
python examples/publish_demos.py docs
```

Note: Several example demo modules currently import the old `SignalData` API or lack a `create_dashboard()` function and are skipped by the generator. If you want the generator to produce full pages, I can update the demos to be `GraphData`-based and add dashboard creation hooks.
